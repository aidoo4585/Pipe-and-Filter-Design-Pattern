# Pipe-and-Filter-Design-Pattern
#Using the Pipe filter pattern to implement the following temperature transformer application 
#Starting with an array of integers representing the temperatures in Celsius [4.5, 12.7, 11, 18.9,
7.90, 5.32]
#Eliminate the top outliner (the maximum)
#Eliminate the bottom outliner (The minimum)
#Transform the degrees into Fahrenheit using the formula (1°C × 9/5) + 32 = 33.8°F)
